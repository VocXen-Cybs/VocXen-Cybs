I’m Quincy, a CompTIA ITF+ holder, with a strong passion for Cybersecurity. I enjoy continuously learning and exploring tools that strengthen my understanding of systems, networks, and security concepts. I am currently building my cybersecurity portfolio on GitHub, having completed several CTF labs, and deepening my skills in network analysis and security tools. I actively explore different operating systems, mostly different distributions of Linux, to strengthen my understanding of system administration, command-line operations, and security fundamentals. This hands-on exploration allows me to better understand how operating systems behave in real-world environments and how they are secured, monitored, and analyzed.
